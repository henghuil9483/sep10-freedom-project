        <h2>History of Market Research</h2>
        <p> Market research came to life in around 1920 when Daniel starch created a theory where advertisement had to be seen, read, believed, and remembered by people. He would approach people on the street and ask them if they read newspapers and if they remembered the ads that showed up in them. Then he would compare it with the other people he asked to see how effective those ads are reaching people. Sooner after, other companies begin to do this too. Ernest Ditcher soon created a new type of consumer research also known as motivational research. He believed consumers had hidden desires , taboos, and secrets. He also believed that products had a soul which was used to serve symbolic meanings and values it had. Basically in short, it's figuring out how far the product can go and market it to people.</p>

            <h2>Present</h2>
            <p>In the present moment , there are tons of tools at our disposal. For example, there are tools like google trends which allows you to surface data from all over the world and can show whats trending at the moment.  The internet greatly impacts this because it allows for market research to conduct more surveys on a larger scale along with research news , communcations, and culture. The most important thing right now is to understand the context surrounding the consumers and studying their behavior and choices .</p>

            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>Perhaps in the future , there could be better inventions as of now. Ideas I have currently are an AI scanner. As it says in the name, itś a scanner that scans items and predicts the outcome of what the sales will be. For example, the Ai will scan the item and analyze the data of how much people bought the item over the past week and will calculate the sales. It scans the ups and downs of the item by seeing the reviews it has so far and giving a breif summary about it. Another idea I have is the AI vr. Itś a glasses you put on which can scan the emotions of your customers. For example, when the person buys the item and uses it,  you can see if they are happy or displeased. This can be determined by their heartbeat and body gestures.</p>
