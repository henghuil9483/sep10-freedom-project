          <p class="centered2">Market research came to life in around 1920 when Daniel starch created a theory where advertisement had to be seen, read, believed, and remembered by people. He would approach people on the street and ask them if they read newspapers and if they remembered the ads that showed up in them. Then he would compare it with the other people he asked to see how effective those ads are reaching people. Sooner after, other companies begin to do this too. Ernest Ditcher soon created a new type of consumer research also known as motivational research. He believed consumers had hidden desires , taboos, and secrets. He also believed that products had a soul which was used to serve symbolic meanings and values it had. Basically in short, it's figuring out how far the product can go and market it to people.</p>
